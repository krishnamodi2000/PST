# PS PROJECTS

To note:

MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE VISUAL STUDIO 2022 VERSION / .NET SDK ABOVE 4.0+
ENSURE THAT YOU BUILD THE CODE ONCE BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
INCASE THE CODE DOES NOT RUN, MAKE A NEW SOLUTION AND COPY PASTE THE FILES TO MATCH YOUR VERSION AND SDK

LMS:

This project uses various concepts of computer science. It covers the fundamentals of C# and .NET 6.0 using Visual Studio 2022 Community version. It uses the general ideas of assemblies, command line instructions, GIT, Agile Methodology, CI/CD pipeline, SOLID Principles and many more basic to higher level concepts of C# programming. It also uses the basics of SQL like DQL, DDL, DML, DCL, CRUD operations, using functions, joins, etc. Further is uses web API module. Lastly concepts like EF Core Code first modelling, HTTP, headers and verbs, and creating APIs using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are put to use in this section. 

Ecomm API:

Along with the concepts covered in the interim project the mock project highlights the use of cloud concepts and helps us publish the web API on Azure cloud. So, principles of Azure Cloud and the services it provides are used along with a basic understanding of pipelines. We use the Agile Model here and the whole project is divided into two sprints. The first sprint covers the methods used in interim project whereas the second sprint elaborates the previously used concepts in addition with higher level concepts like unit testing using NUnit Framework, MOQ databases, and much more. We have implemented a four layer architecture. So this is divided into four layers, i.e., the Data Access Layer, the Business Logic Layer, the Unit Testing Layer and the API/Presentation layer.
